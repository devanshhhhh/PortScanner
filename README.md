# PortScanner
- This tool helps us in identifying vulnerabilities by scanning ports on a given host. 
- Multi-threading has been used to implement the underlying logic. (scanner.py)
- The host is validated with the IPv4 rules using regular expressions.
- It saves the results after a scan in the base project directory in form of a txt file
